Need to make sure IRC geometries and TS freq geometries overlap!!!

IRC geometries:
P.txt
R.txt
T.txt

Coords:
R1.txt
R2.txt

TS geometry:
TS.txt

Need to apply rotation to T.txt, R1.txt, and R2.txt to overlap with the TS vibrational mode 
coordinates. This should change the results of programs such as cosineSim.


Numbering is the same!! Just need to rotate axes.

If TS = x,y,z
    T = y,z,x
